# Lab 2 - Buffer Overflows

Buffer overflow is defined as the condition in which
a program attempts to write data beyond the boundary of a buffer.
This vulnerability can be used by a malicious user
to alter the flow control of the program,
leading to the execution of malicious code.
The objective of this lab is for you to
gain practical insights into this type of vulnerability, and
learn how to exploit the vulnerability in attacks.

More specifically,
in this lab, you will be given a program with a buffer-overflow vulnerability;
your task is to
develop a scheme to exploit the vulnerability and
finally gain the root privilege.

This lab covers the following topics:
- Buffer overflow vulnerability and exploit
- Shellcode (32-bit and 64-bit)
- Stack layout

## Step 0: prepare for a secure practice environment

Modern operating systems have implemented several security mechanisms
to make the buffer-overflow attack difficult.
We disable them to simplify our attacks.

- Ubuntu and several other Linux-based systems
  uses address space randomization (ASLR)
  to randomize the starting address of heap and stack.
  This makes guessing the exact addresses difficult.
  As you will experience later,
  guessing addresses is one of the critical steps of buffer-overflow attacks.
  This feature can be disabled using the following command
```bash
sudo sysctl -w kernel.randomize_va_space=0
```

- In the recent versions of Ubuntu,
  the `/bin/sh` symbolic link points to the `/bin/dash` shell.
  The `dash` program, as well as `bash`,
  has implemented a security countermeasure that
  prevents itself from being executed in a `Set-UID` process.
  Basically, if they detect that they are executed
  in a `Set-UID` process,
  they will immediately change the effective user ID
  to the process’s real user ID,
  essentially dropping the privilege.
  Since our victim program is a `Set-UID` program,
  and our attack relies on running `/bin/sh`, the
  countermeasure in `/bin/dash` makes our attack more difficult.
  Hence, we override the default shell to `zsh`
  that does not have such a countermeasure.
```bash
sudo ln -sf /bin/zsh /bin/sh
```

## Step 1: getting familiar with shellcode

The ultimate goal of buffer-overflow attacks is
to inject malicious code into the target program,
so the code can be executed using the target program’s privilege.
Shellcode is widely used in most code-injection attacks.
Let us get familiar with it in this step.

### The C version of shellcode

A shellcode is basically a piece of code that launches a shell.
If we use C code to implement it, it will look like the following:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    char *name[2];
    name[0] = "/bin/sh";
    name[1] = NULL;
    execve(name[0], name, NULL);
}
```

Unfortunately,
we cannot just compile this code and use the binary code as our shellcode
(modern compiler does way more things than C to binary translation).

The best way to write a shellcode is to use assembly code.
In this lab,
we only provide the binary version of a shellcode,
without explaining how it is written or how works (it is non-trivial).
If you are interested in
how shellcode works and/or
how write a shellcode from scratch,
you can learn that from a diverse range of tutorials online,
such as the [shellcode lab](https://seedsecuritylabs.org/Labs_20.04/Software/Shellcode/)
in the [SEED Labs](https://seedsecuritylabs.org/labs.html) project.

### Invoking the shellcode

In this task,
we will test the shellcode that invokes `/bin/sh` (i.e., spawns a shell)
by putting it into a C program.

```c
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

const char shellcode[] =
#if __x86_64__
  "\x48\x31\xd2\x52\x48\xb8\x2f\x62\x69\x6e"
  "\x2f\x2f\x73\x68\x50\x48\x89\xe7\x52\x57"
  "\x48\x89\xe6\x48\x31\xc0\xb0\x3b\x0f\x05"
#else
  "\x31\xc0\x50\x68\x2f\x2f\x73\x68\x68\x2f"
  "\x62\x69\x6e\x89\xe3\x50\x53\x89\xe1\x31"
  "\xd2\x31\xc0\xb0\x0b\xcd\x80"
#endif
;

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    char code[500];
    strcpy(code, shellcode);        // Copy the shellcode to the stack
    int (*func)() = (int(*)())code;
    func();                         // Invoke the shellcode from the stack
    return 1;
}
```

Now, save the C code into a file named `call_shellcode.c`
and compile it with:

```bash
gcc -m32 -z execstack -o a32.out call_shellcode.c
gcc -z execstack -o a64.out call_shellcode.c
```
You will notice that two binaries are produced
`a32.out` and `a64.out`.

The `call_shellcode.c` file includes two copies of shellcode,
one is 32-bit and the other is 64-bit.
When we compile the program using the `-m32` flag,
the 32-bit version will be used;
without this flag, the 64-bit version will be used.
It should also be noted that
the compilation uses the `-z execstack` option,
which allows code to be executed from the stack;
without this option, the program will fail.

Now run the `./a32.out` and `./a64.out` binaries and
observe what these shellcode programs do.

## Step 2: understanding the vulnerable program

The vulnerable program used in this lab is shown below.
Please first save it in a file named `stack.c` and we will need it later.
This program has a buffer-overflow vulnerability,
and your job is to exploit this vulnerability and gain the root privilege.
But now, let's take some time to first understand it.

```c
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

void buffer_overflow(char *str) {
    char buffer[100];
    strcpy(buffer, str);
}

void dummy_function(char *str) {
    char dummy_buffer[1000];
    memset(dummy_buffer, 0, 1000);
    buffer_overflow(str);
}

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    char str[517];
    FILE *badfile;

    badfile = fopen("badfile", "r");
    if (!badfile) {
       perror("Opening badfile"); exit(1);
    }

    int length = fread(str, sizeof(char), 517, badfile);
    printf("Input size: %d\n", length);
    dummy_function(str);
    fprintf(stdout, "==== Returned Properly ====\n");
    return 0;
}
```

### Analysis

The above program has a buffer overflow vulnerability.
It first reads an input from a file called `badfile`, and then
passes this input to another buffer in the function `buffer_overflow()`.
The original input can have a maximum length of 517 bytes,
but the buffer in `buffer_overflow()` is only 100 bytes long,
which is less than 517.
Because `strcpy()` does not check boundaries,
buffer overflow will occur.
Since this program is a root-owned `Set-UID` program,
if a normal user can exploit this buffer overflow vulnerability,
the user might be able to get a root shell.
It should be noted that the program gets its input from a file called `badfile`.
This file is under users’ control.
Now, our objective is to create the contents for `badfile`,
such that when the vulnerable program copies the contents into its buffer,
a root shell can be spawned.

### Compilation and execution

To compile the program, use the following command
```bash
gcc -m32 -o stack32 -z execstack -fno-stack-protector stack.c
```
This will produce a binary named `stack32`
which you can execute using `./stack32`.

However, this is not a `root`-owned `Set-UID` program yet.
We can achieve this by
first change the ownership of the program to `root` and
then change the permission to `4755` to enable the `Set-UID` bit,
as shown in the following command:
```bash
sudo chown root stack32
sudo chmod 4755 stack32
```

Similar to the shellcode case,
the above instructions produce a 32-bit executable only.
We can obtain a 64-bit version by dropping the `-m32` flag during compilation:
```bash
gcc -o stack64 -z execstack -fno-stack-protector stack.c
sudo chown root stack64
sudo chmod 4755 stack64
```

You will exploit both versions in the following steps.

## Step 3: launching attack on the 32-bit version (`stack32`)

To exploit the buffer-overflow vulnerability in the `stack32` program,
you need to prepare a payload, and save it in a file named `badfile`.
After that, run
```bash
./stack32
```

If your payload exploits the intented vulnerability,
you should expect to see a new shell being created.
If the payload works, renamed the file as `badfile32` to be submitted later.
```bash
mv badfile badfile32
```

## Step 4: launching attack on the 64-bit version (`stack64`)

To exploit the buffer-overflow vulnerability in the `stack64` program,
you need to prepare a payload, and save it in a file named `badfile`.
After that, run
```bash
./stack64
```

If your payload exploits the intented vulnerability,
you should expect to see a new shell being created.
If the payload works, renamed the file as `badfile64` to be submitted later.
```bash
mv badfile badfile64
```
